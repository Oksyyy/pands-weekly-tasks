 # WEEK 03 - weekly task comment
 For week 3, two programs were created: 
  1.  accounts.py - This program handles the main task, which involves generating an account number of a specified length (10 digits)
  2.  accounts_extra.py - This program addresses the extra task, which involves generating an account number of unspecified length 
 
 The task was completed using W3schools tutorials where I learned the following:
 - Slicing strings: [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_slicing.asp)
 - Replacing strings: [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_modify.asp)
 - The len() function: [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp)
 
 For the extra task, I found an article on string multiplication, which helped me mask an unspecified number of digits dynamically: [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-multiple-copies-of-a-string-in-python-by-using-multiplication-operator/).


 # WEEK 04 - weekly task comment

The task was completed primarely using week 4 lecture materials, with a focusg on while loop and if functions.

Additional context on while loops was reviewed in a RealPython article: [RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-while-loop/)

To print out numbers on the same line (I wasn't sure if it was a part of the weekly task or just unintended format of the provided example) - I referred to an article that explaind the use of end='' function: [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfact-50-python-end-parameter-in-print/).


 # WEEK 05 - weekly task comment

The task was completed using 3Wschools Python Datetime tutorial: [3wschools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp), where I learned the following:
   - The datetime module
   - The datetime.datetime.now() function to access current date
   - The strftime() method that was used to return current date in a format where the weekday isrepresented basy a number

Additionally, I used W3schools tutorial to learn about the range() function: [3wschools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp), which was used in the if condition.


 # WEEK 06 - weekly task comment
For week 6, I read multiple articles and watched videos to understand the Newton-Raphson Method for calculating square roots. While I reviewed a variety of sources, I would highlight the following as the most helpful:
1) A comprehensive concept explanation can be found here: [Graphic Maths](https://graphicmaths.com/pure/numerical-methods/newton-raphson-method/)
2) These two sources provided the necessary logic to implement Newton's method in Python:
