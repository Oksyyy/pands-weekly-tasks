 # WEEK 03 - weekly task comment
 - There are 2 programs added: 
    accounts.py - for the main task (i.e. account number with specified length (10 digit))
    accounts_extra.py for the extra  (i.e. account number with unspecified length) 
 - The task was completed using w3schools tutorials where I found information about slicing strings and replacing strings as well as len function
 - To do the Extra part I found this article, that explained string multiplication, which I used for masking an unknown number of digits with X'es making it dynamic: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-multiple-copies-of-a-string-in-python-by-using-multiplication-operator/
 - Comments added to each step of the task to explain the thought process


 # WEEK 04 - weekly task comment
 - The task was completed mostly using week 4 lecture materials, specifically while loop and if functions
 - Additional conntext on while loops was reviewed in RealPython article: https://realpython.com/python-while-loop/
 - To print out numbers in one line (I wasn't sure if it was a part of the weekly task or just unintended format of a given example of running the program) - I used the following article the explaind end = '' function: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gfact-50-python-end-parameter-in-print/


 # WEEK 05 - weekly task comment
 - The task was completed using 3wschools Python Datetime tutorial (https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp), where I learnet the following:
   - datetime module,
   - datetime.datetime.now() function to access current date
   - The strftime() Method that was used to return current date in a format of weekday as a number
 - Additionally, I used 3wschools tutorial to learn about range function: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp, that was used in the if condition
