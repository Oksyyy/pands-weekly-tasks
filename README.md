 # WEEK 03 - weekly task comment
 - There are 2 programs added: 
    accounts.py - for the main task (i.e. account number with specified length (10 digit))
    accounts_extra.py for the extra  (i.e. account number with unspecified length) 
 - The task was completed using w3schools tutorials where I found information about slicing strings and replacing strings as well as len function
 - To do the Extra part I found this article, that explained string multiplication, which I used for masking an unknown number of digits with X'es making it dynamic: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-multiple-copies-of-a-string-in-python-by-using-multiplication-operator/
 - Comments added to each step of the task to explain the thought process
