if today.strftime("%w") in range(1,6):
# use if function to set a condition to check what day of the week today is
# use function .strftime("%w") to get Weekday as a number 0-6, where 0 is Sunday
# use range() function to set a range from 1 to 6 (6 is not included), where 1 = Monday and 5 = Friday 
    
    print('Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.')
    #Â if the number that corresponds to the current day is found in the range from 1 (Monday) to 5 (Friday) (6 expluded), it's a weekday
    # print a message to the user that today is a weekday

else:
# if the above condition evaluation is false, then it's a weekend
    
    print('It is the weekend, yay!')
    # print another message to the user that today is a weekend
